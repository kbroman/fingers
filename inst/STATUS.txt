Version 0.60-2, 11/7/2011

  Added NAMESPACE.


Version 0.59-8, 10/26/2009

  Fixed links in help files.


Version 0.59-7, 10/9/2007

  Minuscule changes to the help files, to conform to a change in R.


Version 0.59-5, 10/16/2006

  Had required library "mva" for hierarchical clustering.  Now that's
  in the package "stats".

  Data sets were in old .RData format; replaced with new format.


Version 0.59-4, 6/22/2003

  In calls to C code (using the .C() function), now make use of the
  PACKAGE argument.


Version 0.59-3, 11/1/2002

  Fixed an error in a help file and changed several functions which
  had an argument "data" to have argument "dat" as this caused an
  error. Also replaced "T" by "TRUE in several functions.


Version 0.59-2, 11/19/2001

  Fixed a few errors in the help files.


Version 0.59, 08/06/2001:

  Added a function avesd.Dsib(), which is like avesd.Dur(), for
  calculating the mean and SD of the distance between siblings
  for the "proportion mismatches" distance.


Version 0.58, 07/09/2001:

  The function fingers() now returns the value of the cutoff used as
  an "attribute."  This is done so that one can obtain the value of
  the optimized cutoff, when that is done.


Version 0.57, 07/06/2001:

  Revised function fingers so that it takes an argument "method" to be
  passed to hclust (for different hierarchical clustering methods,
  such as "average" and "complete").  When "cutoff" is missing, we
  optimize the cutoff to give the cluster result giving the largest
  adj-Rand index; in this case, the true family structure must be
  given via the argument "truefam".


Version 0.56, 07/05/2001:

  Revised "cutoff" and "cutoff.llr" so that there is an argument
  "method" which may be "meansib", "qu" (quantile among unrelateds),
  "qs" (quantile among siblings) and "lr" (likelihood ratio comparing
  unrelateds to siblings).


Version 0.55, 07/02/2001:

  Revise "cluster.stat" so that it may give not just the Rand index,
  but also the adjusted-Rand index, the Fowlkes and Mallows index, and
  Karl Broman's index.


Version 0.54, 06/01/2001:

  Added function cutoff3 and revised cutoff2; both are in C, and
  allow "quick" estimation of the cutoffs using the normal
  approximation, or a non-quick version via simulation or
  enumeration.


Version 0.53, 05/31/2001:

  We've fixed an error in llrdist (which had made it totally wrong).


Version 0.52, 05/18/2001:

  We're just getting started with this package.

  The intent is to reproduce, within R, the FINGERS program written by
  Bill Black (Colorado State), for identifying clusters of full
  sibling families using RAPD data.
